                    As more and more people get vaccinated against COVID-19 and campuses around the U.S. prepare to reopen for fall, students must remain vigilant about protecting themselves, as well as their peers, teachers, and university staff.<br>
                    Dr. Scott Wesley Long, a clinical pathologist, microbiologist, and prolific infectious disease researcher, says unvaccinated students returning to campus or in-person classes should continue to practice social distancing by "avoiding crowds, parties, sporting events, or unnecessary social contact until the threat of COVID-19 has passed."<br>
                    The latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) permits fully vaccinated individuals to "resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance."<br>
                    Staying informed can help students cope with the evolving news around COVID-19. So far hundreds of colleges and universities have announced plans to mandate COVID-19 inoculation for returning students.<br>
                    Despite this trend, not every institution plans to require vaccination. "Ask your college and workplace if they have a plan for dealing with COVID-19," advises Long.<br>
                    He also stressed that students should remain calm and be prepared. "COVID-19 appears to be relatively mild in young adults, with most severe cases occurring in the elderly," said Long. "If a student is concerned for their health, they should contact student health or their primary care provider by phone to seek guidance."<br>
                    College students are also strongly encouraged to get an available COVID-19 vaccine.<br>
