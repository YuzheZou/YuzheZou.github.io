                    The provisional counts for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths are based 
                    on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. 
                    National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the 
                    District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. 
                    It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be 
                    submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and 
                    tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely 
                    not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the 
                    more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and 
                    may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from 
                    the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published 
                    sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

                    Table 1 has counts of deaths involving COVID-19 and other select causes of death by 
                    time-period in which the death occurred, sex and age group.  For data on deaths 
                    involving COVID-19 by month, year, jurisdiction, sex, and age, Socrata icon Click 
                    here to download. This data file contains two sets of age groups: (1) age-groups 
                    consistent with those used across CDC COVID-19 surveillance pages, and (2) age groups 
                    that are routinely included in NCHS mortality reports. When analyzing the file, the 
                    user should make sure to select only the desired age groups. Summing across all age 
                    categories provided will result in double counting deaths from certain age groups. 
                    For data on deaths involving COVID-19 by week, sex, and age (by NCHS age groups), 
                    Socrata icon Click here to download. Data on deaths involving COVID-19 among ages 
                    0–18 are available here.
